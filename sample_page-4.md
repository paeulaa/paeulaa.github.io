## VR Wheelchair Basketball

Exploring How VR Can Empower Physical Activity for People with Disabilities

***

### Project Overview

We designed VR Wheelchair Basketball to explore how VR can help people with physical disabilities stay active at home. Traditional adaptive sports equipment can be expensive and inaccessible, but immersive VR offers a more affordable and flexible alternative.

***

### Design Insights

Through interviews with a wheelchair basketball player (Chairman), we learned the sport emphasizes:
- Quick and agile chair movement
- Strategic positioning
- Coordinated upper-body control

These insights shaped our prototype â€” focused on replicating the physical experience, not just visual immersion.

### Prototype & Iteration
Key features:
- **Hand gesture tracking** for shooting
- **Wheel rotation tracking** for movement

User testing revealed disorientation after prolonged play. In response, we added:
- **Instructional UI**
- A **floating wheelchair indicator** (color-coded) to help users stay oriented.

### Outcome
Testers described the experience as physically demanding, which validated our goal of promoting exercise. The project was presented at IEEE AIxXR Conference, where I represented the team.

### My Role
I contributed as a **product designer** and **product manager**:
- Designed game flow and UI prefabs
- Coordinated team progress and communication
- Presented the project at IEEE AIxXR Conference on behalf of the team
