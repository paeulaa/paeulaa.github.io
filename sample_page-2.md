## CM4AI Talent Knowledge Graph

CM4AI Knowledge Graph is an interactive visualization platform designed to help researchers explore a large-scale academic graph.

***

### Abstract

The graph features over 28,000 AI experts, 1,000+ biomedical datasets, and 5,000+ bio entities, visualized through a dynamic WebGL interface combined with LLM-powered recommendations. Users can browse the graph, apply filters, and receive AI-suggested collaborators and resources â€” with transparent explanations for each suggestion.

Compared to traditional tools like Gephi, the platform provides smoother performance and richer interactivity, making it especially useful for navigating large, complex academic networks.

### Frontend Development Highlights
<br>
As part of the development team, my contributions included:
- Integrating 5,000+ BioEntity nodes into the graph
- Tuning node appearance and setting CM4AI as the default highlighted category
- Implementing publication count and author begin year filters to support dynamic filtering by experience and publication volume
- Developing a selectable legend to control visibility of different node categories
- Troubleshooting and improving the display of author data
- Enhancing label scaling behavior to improve readability across zoom levels and interaction states
